Setting up virtual environment, you dont have to do this but I mean why not 
python3 -m venv path/to/venv

ACTIVATION 
source path/to/venv/bin/activate

then install the requirenments by 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

In order to run backend and frontend at the same time, you have to clone 
the same project two different times.
